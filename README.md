# Lie-Detector
This project uses a pulse sensor with Arduino Uno to measure heart rate, sending data to Python for analysis with scikit-learnâ€™s logistic regression. Limitations include reliance on a single sensor, making predictions inaccurate. Adding sensors like GSR or respiration, along with advanced models and better datasets, can greatly improve results.
